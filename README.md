# Timer-Program-in-Python
Countdown Timer Program This is a basic countdown timer program written in Python. The program allows the user to set a timer, and it will count down from the specified time, printing the remaining seconds until the timer reaches zero. When the countdown reaches zero, it prints "Times Up!" to signal the end.
